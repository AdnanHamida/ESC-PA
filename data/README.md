You can download the zip file of the data from the following links

- [train and validation date](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLBNBlCqO2lL62HtJHAJ7-dDB3SxPTKQ/view?usp=share_link)

Note that you can also download each dataset from its respective source, whether it be training, validation, or testing. This is just my compilation of all the datasets. Training and validation datasets are converted to grayscale and saved in lossless TIFF format. Note that under the training data, there are two directories: one for full dimensions and one for image slices. The sliced images are the ones used to train our models, as described in our papers.
